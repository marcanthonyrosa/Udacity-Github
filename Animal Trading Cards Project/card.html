			<p>Highly distinctive, the male lion is easily recognised by its mane, and its face is one of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture. Lions vary in color but typically sport light yellow-brown coats. The only social member of the cat (Felidae) family, lions live in large groups called "prides," consisting of about 15 lions.</p>
