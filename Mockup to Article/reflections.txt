This has been a great day so far! While most of this has been more refresher, it’s been amazing to review past lessons and continue building a solid HTML foundation. For example, I was never familiar with <figure> and <figcaption> before! I also had never played around with the subscript (<sub>) tag before. So cool! 

It’s been a bit easy to recap past lessons and continue building off of this foundation.

In terms of challenging aspects, it’s been a bit difficult to lean on personal research (via the Mozilla docs) to learn new things, instead of being shown directly. That’s a small change of pace. 

I’m excited to continue leaning on personal learning and individual research to better my skill set. Really excited to continue making progress!
